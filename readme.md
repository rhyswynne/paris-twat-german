Paris Twat-German
=================

This as a drunken project to learn how to make a Chrome Extension by replacing all mentions of "Donald Trump" with "Paris Twat-German". Inspired by an original tweet by The Don and a much funnier and witty tweet from [Scott Edwards](https://twitter.com/Edwards80). He's a nicer person, follow him.

Made by [Rhys Wynne](http://www.rhyswynne.co.uk) of [Winwar Media](https://winwar.co.uk).

Installation
------------

It isn't live in the Chrome Store (it looks quite a scary place), so instead here's a guide on how to install it should you wish to.

* Download and unzip to a folder on your site.
* Go to Window > Extensions and tick "Developer Mode".
* Click "Load Unpacked Extension" and then open the directory you unpacked in step 1.
* Go to any page with the words "Donald Trump" and you should see it replaced. 

Future
------

This was more of a learning exercise, however I can think of ways to improve it.

* Get it on the Chrome Web Store. Though the comments with similar extensions seem scary.
* Work it so that Donald J* Trump regex works too.
